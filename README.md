# JEAYNE's private code signing Certification Autority (CA)

To download JEAYNE's private code signing CA right-click on **[`jeayne_CA.crt`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JEAYNE/Private.Code.Signing.CA/refs/heads/main/jeayne_CA.crt)** and select '_Save Link As..._'<br/>
Then install this certificate from your download directory by double-clicking on it.

‚ö†Ô∏è HOWEVER, as this is a _private_ CA, simply accepting the default options does not work.
Please, read the **[wiki](https://github.com/JEAYNE/Private.Code.Signing.CA/wiki)** first.

üëâ IMPORTANT: When installing this certificate, you will have to verify its thumbprint.<br/>
It must be **`1f52c9f0e1a6bb29a172d438011494f6b877f97b`**, if not, stop the installation.

This task needs to be performed only once per computer.

Thank you for your trust!

JEAYNE
